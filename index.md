## Who are we?

We are a [working
group](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/working-groups/) dedicated to
organizing all of 18F's information and making it universally accessible and
useful, internally and externally.

## What do we do/what have we done?

Some of our projects include the [18F Hub](https://hub.18f.gov/), [18F
Pages](https://pages.18f.gov/), and [18F
Guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides/). We've also had a hand in relaunching
the Onboarding Working Group and in spawning the [18F Edu
team](https://pages.18f.gov/edu/).

## Where are we/how can you reach us?

Our 18F Slack channel is #wg-documentation. We hold regular meetings on
Tuesdays at 1:30pm Eastern Time.
